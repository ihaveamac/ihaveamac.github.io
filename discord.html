		<h1>ihaveahax's stuff on Discord - <a href="https://discord.gg/YVuFUrs">Join</a></h1>
		
		<p>I run a server on Discord for discussion, assistance, and release notifications about the things I make, such as ninfs and custom-install.</p>
		<p>It's a pretty small and slow server but I always try to help when I see new questions. Others are also able to help with the problems you have.</p>
		<p>This page exists to explain the setup before you join.</p>

		<h2>Rules</h2>

		<ol start="0">
			<li>Be nice to eachother</li>
			<li>No piracy (asking how to get paid games for free)</li>
			<li>Don't spam</li>
			<li>No bigotry</li>
			<li>No NSFW content</li>
			<li>Use common sense, just because it's not explicitly denied doesn't mean it's OK</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Channel structure</h2>

		<p>(as of October 26, 2020)</p>
		<p>There are 10 public channels, 5 of which allow for discussion.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Top-level
				<ul>
					<li><b>#welcome</b> - rules, quick links, other info</li>
					<li><b>#announcements</b> - release announcements, other (usually) important messages (rarely, if ever, pings everyone)</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Other questions</h2>

		<h3>What happens when I join?</h3>

		<p>Pretty much nothing! There's no bot that sends you a message on join. No join messages are posted publicly (moderators and I do see this though). All the channels listed above are immediately available (except in exceptional circumstances such as spam).</p>

		<h3>Can I ask you my question privately?</h3>
		
		<p>It's usually a good idea to ask in one of the public channels, since you might get an answer faster. I'm likely not the only one who can answer your question.</p>
		<p>Still, if asking in public makes you too anxious or uncomfortable, feel free to send me a message. I understand sometimes it might be difficult to talk in a public area, I'm not gonna be upset!</p>

		<h3>Can I ask you in a voice channel?</h3>

		<p>I'm not really comfortable using voice channels, either to listen or talk. Sorry.</p>

		<h3>I'm not comfortable using Discord, is there another way to contact you?</h3>

		<p>You can send me a message at ian [at] ianburgwin [dot] net. Or create an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository (certain ones will send a notification to #git-issues on Discord).</p>

		<h3>Why are you explaining this?</h3>

		<p>Some people get anxiety joining public spaces for a variety of reasons (like me!). I'm hoping that explaining how everything works helps anyone who doesn't know what to expect.</p>
		<p>I'm not really a judgemental person. I hope I can make you feel safe here regardless of identity, the games and content you're interested in, English ability, current knowledge, etc.</p>
